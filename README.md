**Project Title: Customer Purchase Analysis**

**Project Description:**

In this project, I worked with database that contains customer and purchase data. The goal was to perform various analyses to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

**Data Source:**

- Customers Table: Contains customer information (customer_id, name, email, etc.).
- Products Table: Contains product information (product_id, name, price, category, etc.).
- Purchases Table: Contains purchase information (purchase_id, customer_id, product_id, purchase_date, quantity, total_amount, etc.).

**Project Tasks:**

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Calculate basic statistics on the dataset, such as the total number of customers, products, and purchases.
   - Determine the most popular product categories.
   - Identify the top customers in terms of total purchase amount.

2. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Segment customers into groups based on their purchase behavior (e.g., frequent buyers, high spenders, etc.).
   - Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.

3. **Product Analysis:**
   - Find the best-selling products.
   - Analyze the sales trends over time (e.g., monthly or yearly).
   - Identify products with low sales that may need additional marketing.

4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis:**
   - Calculate the CLV for each customer.
   - Determine the average CLV for different customer segments.

5. **Churn Analysis:**
   - Identify customers who haven't made a purchase in a while (define your criteria for churn).
   - Analyze the reasons for churn and suggest strategies for customer retention.

6. **Market Basket Analysis:**
   - Identify products that are often purchased together (e.g., association rules).
   - Suggest product recommendations based on the analysis.
